# Visualizer

Visualizer is a tool for analyzing and visualizing the behavior of C programs. It builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and a Control Flow Graph (CFG) to help users better understand program structure and execution paths.

## Overview

The tool constructs:
- Abstract Syntax Tree (AST): represents the syntactic structure of the source code.
- Control Flow Graph (CFG): visualizes possible execution paths through the program.

These representations simplify code analysis and debugging, making it easier to identify errors and reason about program logic.

## Purpose

The project aims to:
- simplify static code analysis
- improve debugging workflow
- help detect errors more effectively
- enhance understanding and testing of C source code

## Result

The outcome is a working prototype that improves comprehension of C programs by providing visual representations of the source code structure (AST) and control flow (CFG).

## Technologies

- C#
- WinForms
